# OG â€” Better Share on Social Media

Very tiny Open Graph plugin - add featured image as facebook image. This plugin do not have any configuration - you can check how it works looking into page source.

***No configuration, pure power.***

We believe this plugin is the best option for beginners because it has no configuration, you need only install and activate it - all magic will be done!
